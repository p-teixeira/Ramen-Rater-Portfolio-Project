-- With that out of the way, let's get to analyzing! 
-- First thing's first, let's calculate instant noodle consumption per capita per region using the noodle
-- consumption and population data from the ramenconsumption and ramencountry tables. Let's include the 
-- region population as well for some added context.

SELECT Region, FORMAT(SUM(Avg_Population),0) AS Region_Population,
ROUND(AVG(Avg_Consumption / Avg_Population),2) AS Yearly_Consumption_Per_Capita

-- Yep, Asia is first, no surprises there. They sure do like their noodles (and boy is there
-- a lot of people in Asia!). Let's get a little more granular and see per subregion instead of region.

GROUP BY Subregion
ORDER BY Yearly_Consumption_Per_Capita DESC;

-- A little bit of a closer fight within the Asian subregions, with East Asia and Southeast Asia carrying
-- most of the weight. It makes sense; South Asian countries like India and Pakistan don't come across as
-- particularly hot markets for instant noodles, for example, and the data seems to support that. Okay, let's
-- get even more granular and look at countries next. Since there will be tons more rows this time, let's
-- add row numbers to make the results easier to interpret.

SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(

-- There we have it, South Korea reigns supreme. Interestingly, the first country out of Asia to rank is
-- Guatemala, coming in at 17th. 

-- Let's change gears a bit and look at the star ratings from The Ramen Rater's data now.

-- That's better. Well, looks like most of the reviews are within the 3~3.99 star range. But more surprising is
